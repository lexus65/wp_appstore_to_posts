You\u2019ve probably noticed this already, but you can be a Medium in one store and a Large in another. Different brands use different sizing charts with different measurements, depending on where they\u2019re from in the world and their local audiences. That\u2019s why a lot of online stores offer measurement tables to help you find your size on you own. Helpful? Not really. When was the last time you had a measuring tape with you when you saw the top of your dreams during your morning commute? Or at work? Or anywhere?? MySizeID solves this problem \u2013 and many more:\n\n* MySizeID measures with your phone, so it\u2019s with you at all times\n\n* Measure yourself once and save your data to see your sizes for any brand your browse later on\n\n* We don\u2019t use cameras or estimate your size based on images (so don\u2019t worry about sending in body photos) \u2013 your measurements are taken with a unique patented algorithm that uses your phone\u2019s sensors\n\n* Once we\u2019ve created your personal sizing ID, you can use it in any store that offers MySizeID \u2013 you\u2019ll see your suggested sizes, according to your perfect fit, wherever you browse\n\n* Enjoy every parcel you get! When you\u2019re certain about your size, you can shop without a care in the world, knowing that everything will fit (so you won\u2019t have to put your frowny face on and use that return shipment sticker\u2026)\n\nAt the end of the day, who really cares if you order a Medium, a Large, or an X-Large? Those labels don\u2019t mean much these days. We just want to help you find the items that fit and look great on you! So, let\u2019s forget about those size charts and look at what really matters \u2013 personal measurements for a perfect fit.","trackId":1433748661,"artistId":1031088132,"artistName":"My Size Israel 2014 Ltd.","genres":["Shopping","Utilities"],"price":0,"bundleId":"com.mysize.mysizeid","isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"formattedPrice":"Free","averageUserRating":4.5,"userRatingCount":93}]}
