Adds a shortcode that displays reviews and ratings of an app from the iOS AppStoreâ€™s country you chose.

== Description ==

This plugin created selected types of post from Appstore reviews

What does it do?

Every time someone opens the page, instead of downloading the reviews again, the plugin will read them from the cache file. If the cache file is too old, the plugin will try to download new reviews from Apple's servers.

This plugin created selected types of post from Appstore reviews.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I see nothing? =
You may not have any review for the app in the country you selected. If you have reviews and still see nothing, it is because the iTunesConnect API sometimes doesn't work properly when trying to retrieve the Customer Reviews. That's why this plugin caches them once it downloaded the most recent ones.
